# Simple REST API

This is a simple REST API built using .NET 8, Minimal API, and PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a running instance of PostgreSQL. You need to set up the PostgreSQL connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.
2. Optionally, you can run both PostgreSQL and the API in Docker containers.
